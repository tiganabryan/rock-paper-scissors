need to create array of rock paper scissors

log array

need to pick an index from array

pick random number

round random number

pick random index from array

pick random index between 0 and 10

pick random index between 0 and 2

problem: how do I tell computer the rules?

rock > scissors
scissors > paper
paper > rock

if comp rock and human scissors, comp wins

does rock always win?

rock wins? eval.
how to tell which selection wins?
either assign each selection a number but that doesn't work because each can only win in one instance in the game

rock vs scissors, winner = rock
rock vs paper, winner = paper
paper vs scissors, winner = scissors

if playerselection == winner, give "you win" statement
if playerselection !== winner, give "you lose" statement

NVM organize with ternary but include line breaks or readability. NVM

winner = ()

evaluate which user chose the winning option.
if human chose it, give the "you win" statement.

return whichever matches winner's value.

if returns the first truthy value.

if (playerselection == winner)

write you win

WHAT DID I LEARN

I learned I can group conditions in my if else statements together, and also to group multiple correct outcomes together. instead of writing "you won" multiple times I grouped every instance together. also those instance grouped together need to be wrapped in brackets
I learned how to use return values in functions. you need to actually return something, and it can be text!
logging a function with a return value is how you see the return value.
